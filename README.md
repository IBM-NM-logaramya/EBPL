1. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) use sensors, cameras, and AI to navigate without human input.


2. Robotics refers to machines designed to perform tasks, often using automation and artificial intelligence.


3. AVs rely on lidar, radar, GPS, and computer vision for environment perception.


4. Machine learning algorithms enable both AVs and robots to learn from data and improve performance.


5. Robotics includes various fields like industrial robots, service robots, and mobile robots.


6. AVs aim to reduce accidents, improve traffic flow, and provide mobility for non-drivers.


7. Ethical and safety concerns are key challenges in deploying AVs and autonomous robots.


8. Connectivity (V2X) helps AVs communicate with infrastructure, other vehicles, and pedestrians.


9. Robotics is widely used in manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, and space exploration.


10. Both technologies are advancing rapidly, pushing the boundaries of automation and intelligent systems.
